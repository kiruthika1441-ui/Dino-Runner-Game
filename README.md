# Dino-Runner-Game
The Dino Game is an endless runner where a dinosaur runs through a desert. Players must jump or duck to avoid cacti and flying birds. The game speeds up over time, testing quick reflexes and focus. With no final level, the goal is to survive as long as possible and score higher with each run, making it fun, simple, and addictive.
